# Clone of the Snake Game
The snake game is known as one of the first games published on Nokia devices. 
This project stimulates a way of cloning the snake game.

Use W, A, S, and D buttons on your keyboard to move the snake upwards, downwards, left, and right. Collect apples or "food" to grow longer. The longer the snake is, the faster it moves.
